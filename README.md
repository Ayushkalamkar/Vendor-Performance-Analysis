The Vendor Performance Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI analytics project designed to evaluate vendor efficiency, profitability, purchase patterns, sales contribution, and capital utilization.
This dashboard provides a data-driven approach to vendor management by transforming raw purchase and sales data into meaningful KPIs and interactive visualizations.
It helps businesses monitor vendor contribution, identify high-performing vendors and brands, track profit margins, and analyze unsold inventory capital.
The project simulates a real-world retail or distribution business scenario where multiple vendors supply different brands, and management needs insights for strategic decision-making.
